## Added

- (#2024) Added materialized occurrence notes to the Relationships widget, so recurring parent task notes can show their occurrence notes in an **Occurrences** tab. See [Relationships Widget](https://tasknotes.dev/features/inline-tasks/#relationships-widget). Thanks to @3zra47 for requesting this.
- (#2022) Added a **Skip instance** / **Unskip instance** action to the recurring task edit modal's completion calendar, so skipped dates can be adjusted from the same date menu as completions. See [Recurring Tasks](https://tasknotes.dev/features/recurring-tasks/#completion-tracking). Thanks to @AmonAmarthFTW for requesting this.
- (#2048) Added current due and scheduled dates to the edit modal's task information. Thanks to @1activegeek for requesting this.
